# Project-Chinua-Soyinka


A speech Syntheses (TTS) software that translates from written English to spoken Igbo and Yoruba languages


this project is named after the phenomenal late Chinua Achebe and the Living Legend Wole Soyinka. They are Nigerian novelists, poets, and advocates of  Nigerian native languages.

Project-Chinua-Soyinka was built using googles tts and translate apis

## Getting Started

First, install python on your pc ðŸ’»  or Mac machine  


Then install Google's translate and text to speech libraries on your computer.
using the following line of code in your default terminal or any terminal of choice.

```cmd
pip install gTTS
```
### Then
```cmd
pip install translators --upgrade
```

as soon as both installations are completed, run the program while connected to the internet


n.b it's been a minute since I wrote this program ,therefore, this repo code might be outdated, but hopefully, Google hasn't changed the way programs interact with their api's ,so I think it should work alright .!!
